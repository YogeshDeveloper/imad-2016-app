              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I was at this place called Galona, almost forest nearby my home. I like to go there. Many times I go there. Just to think. After walking enough I found my place and sat there, watching that usual banyan tree. But there was something unusual. So I stood up and moved toward the tree. There was a monk. I had never seen him around but he was there in his comfortable position, eyes were open looking at my direction but I think he hadn't seen me yet. I stood there for minute. He did not move. I don't know why I was standing before him like that, he was stranger. But he was a monk. And he did not look like that usual monks in India, who just roam around for food and something. And he looked at me. I mean he moved his eyeballs and smiled. I smiled too. Then he returned to his comfortable eyeball position and may be in deep thought (or no thought) also.
  </p><br><br><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt like to strike conversation to him but I can't just say 'hi' to him. I stood there for another half minute thinking of returning back to my place but just then he spoke. I don't know what he spoke but it had not more words in it. I don't even know what that language was. He spoke again without waiting me to reply and this time with hand gesture to tell me to sit down. Although we were alone and he was stranger to me I did not feel any danger. So I found a place and sat down near him. After silence for a while he started to speak. With full of hand gestures and facial expressions but in the same language making me not to understand. His face was full of facial hairs but I saw every facial feeling he communicating. Even though I did not understand a penny of it I knew it was worthwhile, I felt that. I was only responding in throttle voice but I don't think he needed any responses. He was only speaking. At first he looked a monk type monk but letter he looked more than monk. I don't know what was that, who was that. After sometime he stood up and left. And before that he bid goodbye not with hand gestures but by words that I can understand.

Sometimes you don't understand thing but you know this is great and you feel it. It really is great.</p>
